###Description:
A single-player betting game. The player starts off with $100 and is asked to place a bet between $5 and $10. They then enter a number between 1 and 10 in order to guess the correct number. If they get the number exactly, they double their money. If they are only off by 1, they get to keep their bet. Otherwise they lose their bet. The game ends if the player loses all their money.
